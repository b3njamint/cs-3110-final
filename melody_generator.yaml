  Our project is an interactive melody generator. It takes in a tonality, key, 
  and the length of the desired melody and returns a list of notes representing 
  the generated melody. Some features that we have include providing the option 
  to set the last three notes to pre-specified indexes that match with the 
  inputted key in order to generate a "better sounding" melody.
