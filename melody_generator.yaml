title: "The Melody Generator"

  Our project is an interactive melody generator. It takes in a key, tonality, 
  and the length of the desired melody and returns a list of notes representing 
  the generated melody. Some features that we have include setting the first few
  and last few notes to some pre-specified indexes that match with the inputted
  key in order to generate a "better sounding" melody. GUIs are not supported
  yet but will be in the future.
