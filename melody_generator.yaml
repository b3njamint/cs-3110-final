  Our project is an interactive melody generator. It takes in a key, tonality, 
  and the length of the desired melody and returns a list of notes representing 
  the generated melody, the respective chords to be played with the melody, a 
  note sheet that gives a visual representation of the notes generated, and the 
  seed of the melody. Additionally, there is audio output for the melody 
  generated. Some additional features that we have include setting the first 
  few and last few notes to some pre-specified indexes that match with the 
  inputted key in order to generate a "better sounding" melody. To add on, we 
  also provided the user with options for the audio output which include sine,
  square, saw, and triangle.
